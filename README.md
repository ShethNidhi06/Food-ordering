#Introduction
 Ordering food online is very simple, the customer has to select the desired food items
from the displayed menu, the total cost will be displayed to the customer. Later the
customer has to select the payment method which includes Net Banking/UPI/Debit
Card/Credit Card/CashOnDelivery. After selecting payment method, the customer has to
enter the address where the food needs to be delivered. Mobile number is also required if
the delivery person wants to contact.
